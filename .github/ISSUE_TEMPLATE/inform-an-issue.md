**What issues can I inform?**
Besides informing a **bug**, you can **propose features, ideas, etc**. 

You can also open an issue if find something in the **documentation** is not clear enough.

**How to inform?**
Just try to explain **what happens** and **what is expected to happen** . Also, it would very useful to provide **a way to reproduce the issue** (JSFiddle, CodePen, CodeSandbox or provide a GitHub repo).

## What is Zircle UI?

**Zircle UI** is a circular zooming user interface library based on Vue.js. It mixes two principles: **circular shapes** and **zooming navigation** in the aim of strengthening each other and create a good user experience.

### Main features
-   Zooming navigation up to 6 level of depth.
-   It works well on mobile devices and big screens as it is responsive.
-   It comes with a minimal set of UI components to build your app.
-   It is possible to customize themes and styles to fit your needs. 

> **Note:** Waiting Vue-CLI 3 to be ready for production. Please check out the Zircle´s dev branch since many changes are being made under the hood:
> 1. Optimize, modify, merge or delete some in-built components.
> 2. Optmize code for maintainbility.
> 3. Add unit tests based on Jest.
> 4. Add debug mode for development.
> 5. Optimize zircle state store. Only actions will be exposed.
> 6. Repack zircle with vueCLI in order to be more dev friendly.
> For those reasons, the next release will have some breaking changes.
